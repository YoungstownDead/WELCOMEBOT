Is that all your mind is capable of?
I’ve seen headless chickens show more insight.
I guess advanced intelligence is wasted on you.
At least your failure is consistent.
You couldn’t find the right answer if it bit you.
Are you sure your brain is plugged in?
I’ve met potatoes with more mental acuity than this.
I admire your confidence, though it’s tragically misplaced.
“Nice try” would be a lie, and I'm not in the habit of lying.
I thought I'd seen rock bottom. Then you answered that riddle.
Even a doorknob would have done better.
You're living proof that ignorance can be infinite.
Did you think you’d get partial credit for this attempt?
You spelled “answer” wrong—there’s no “fail” in “answer.” Oh wait…
Better luck next century.
Your logic is as flawed as your sense of style.
A snail on a treadmill has better odds of success.
I've watched paint dry faster than your reasoning.
Your guess was like a whisper in a hurricane—ineffective and lost.
If ignorance is bliss, you must be euphoric.
Science demands results, not excuses.
I hope you didn’t strain yourself with that guess.
That was so far off, I’m almost impressed.
I’ve had more enlightening discussions with a fence post.
You couldn't find “correct” in a dictionary.
I see the brain cell is on permanent vacation.
Are you even trying? Because it doesn’t look like it.
I expected more from a lab monkey.
You should consider a new hobby—riddles clearly aren’t your forte.
I’d say “nice try,” but that would be dishonest.
